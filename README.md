# RESILIENCE GYM WEBSITE
## Description
This is a fictional gym created for my first Milestone Project.

The purpose of this website is to attract and inform potential customers of the services on offer at Resilience Gym.

The website is split into 5 main pages:

- Home: An Introduction to the gym with a map of where the gym is.
- About Us: Background to the gym such as how long it has been around.
- What we Offer: Information on what we offer including classes, personal training and programmes.
- Contact Us: A form to contact the gym personel for queries about training sessions, classes, programmes etc as well as any general enquires.
- Sign Up: A Sign Up page to create an account and join the gym.

## User Experience (UX)

![Responsive Design Image](https://github.com/ShaunWard/Milestone-Project-One/blob/master/images/responsive-design-image.png?raw=true)

This site was created to present to potential customers what is available at Resilience Gym.

The colour scheme was used to clearly break up areas of the page from the navigation, to the page content and images, to the details in the footer. The colours chosen, such as red and black, were used to help create a powerful feeling within the viewer to make them feel empowered and want to make a change and get fit.

The page layout was designed to suit any screen size. The navigation bar will collapse into a drop down menu for smaller screens. Muliple images will arrange themselves from horizontal to vertical, as will the footer, all of which will help with a change in screen size.

Features such as the image carousel and flipboxes were used to make the page less static and to make the user feel more engaged in the experience of using the site. They also provide a useful way of presenting the images and information on classes and programmes.
